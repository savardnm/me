        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

        <p class="content">My name is Nathan Savard, I'm a Junior Robotics Engineering major at Worcester Polytechnic
            Institute
            (WPI), and I
            love robots!</p>
        <p class="content">I made this website to show off the different projects I've worked on. It has my school,
            personal,
            and (non-confidential) work projects. I have a lot of fun with what I make, so I wanted to strut my stuff in
            a space
            a little more personal than my LinkedIn or Resume. I've made this website by myself using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript
            to make it more personal to me.</p>

        <h2>So, Where are the Projects?</h2>
        <a href="projects.html" class="back" style="padding: 8px">Right Here!</a>
        <p class="content">Feel free to peruse the selection at your own pace. I'll be happy to show off what I've been
            working on!</p>


        <p class="content"><br><br><br>Disclaimer: This site is still under construction, so it is still a little rough
            around the corners. Stay tuned for new things to come! If you encounter any bugs, please report
