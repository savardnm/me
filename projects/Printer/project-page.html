            <h2 id="desc">Project Description</h2>
            <p class="content">
                Ever since middle school, I've always wanted to build my own 3D Printer. I'll never forget learning
                about them for the first time from my neighbor, who built one in his apartment. Since then, I've dreamed
                of making my own. Now, I finally get to.
                <br><br>
                I worked more with 3D printers through high-school, modelling and printing my own joints, gears, and
                other parts. My first project was creating a 3D-printed fan with a simple DC electric motor inside.
            </p>
            <h2 id="solidworks">SolidWorks</h2>
            <p class="content">
                I modelled all of the parts used in my assembly using SolidWorks. I used dimension specification from
                online documentation. I created the design from scratch. I took inspiration from a couple of sources
                including the Modix Big-60, the Ultimaker Pro, and the Prusa printer series. I wanted to make a
                heavy-duty printer that could handle any print I could ever want.
            </p>
            <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
            <h3 id="frame">Frame</h3>
            <p class="content">
                Due to the large size of the printer, I needed to use an aluminum extrusion frame. These pieces are used
                to provide structure and prevent the acrylic from warping. The frame is enclosed in clear acrylic
                sheets. These sheets we precision-cut using a laser cutter. This fabrication method allows me to
                pre-center all precision mounting holes. This simplifies the construction because careful alignment is
                ensured by the acrylic.
                <br><br>
                I also used a tooth-alignment system for the edges of the acrylic. Each pane has a negative of the
                border of the adjacent panes. This allows the different sheets to mesh together. This increases strength
                and simplifies construction. The specific design of the panes forces the frame to assembled accurately,
                without the need of major adjustments.

            <h3 id="axes">XYZ Axes</h3>
            <p class="content">
                The printer uses a standard cartesian 3-axis printing design: a Z-axis controlled by the bed height and
                an XY axis controlled by the gantry. The Z-motion is controlled by 2 motors, with a total of 4
                lead-screws. This design was inspired by the Modix Big-60, which is capable of holding extremely heavy
                prints. The XY motion is controlled by linear rails attached to timing belts.
            </p>
            <h3 id="board">Control Board</h3>
            <p class="content">
                The design is planned to use a Smoothie-Board V5 to control the motion of the printer. I chose this
                board because it is a 32-bit processor. This makes it more responsive and allows the user to upload
                configuration data without re-flashing the board. This simplifies the setup of the printer. It also
                comes equipped with 5 stepper motor drivers, which matches the amount of motors required to move the
                3-axes and extruder.
            </p>
            <h3 id="bed">Heated Bed</h3>
            <p class="content">
                When constructing the board, one requirement was a heated bed. I did this because I
                wanted the printer to be capable of printing most materials. One specific material I wanted to print was
                ABS.
                This plastic does not adhere well to cold surfaces, so A heated bed opens up more possibilities for
                printing materials.
