            <h2 id="desc">Project Description</h2>
            <p class="content">Each year WPI hosts a 48-hour hackathon open to all students. For the 2020 hackathon, a
                group of my friends and I decided to enter. At the time, study spaces were extremely hard to find on
                campus. This made it hard to get work done between class because a lot of time would be spent moving to
                different areas. There was no central location to search for all the locations. The only reservation
                system, 25Live, was difficult to navigate and unreliable.
                <br><br>
                To solve this problem, my team decided to create a "study space finder" app for our campus. To simplify
                production, we wanted to make it as a mobile-friendly web-application. Thus, Study@WPI was born.

                <br><br>
                The project can be found at:

            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p class="content">
                Our program was coded using HTML5 and JavaScript. The website was hosted on GitHub Pages. Since we did
                not have access to a web server, we made it a passive website, which could be hosted on GitHub.
            </p>
            <h3>API</h3>
            <p class="content">Our program interacted with the same API as 25Live to get reservation data for all the
                rooms, from all buildings on campus. The program sorted through this data to find rooms without current
                reservations. These open rooms can be found by pressing the "Study Now" Button.
                <br><br>
                The user can also select
                a date/time they want to study later. This allows the student to plan the locations they can work on
                campus ahead of time</p>
            <img src="calendar.png" class="fullpic">
            <p class="content">The website also provides links to the various reservation systems implemented by WPI for
                individual locations. This includes: 25Live for rooms, LibCal for library suites, and Foisie-LibCal for
                tech suites. </p>
