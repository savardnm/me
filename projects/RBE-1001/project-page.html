            <h2 id="desc">Project Description</h2>
            <p class="content">Introduction to robotics was my first robotics class at WPI. In it, I learned the basics
                of electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering concepts. The class concluded in a final challenge
                using a robot constructed from VEX parts. This robot had to lift small wooden blocks into specific
                shelves on the playing field. To accomplish this, my group used a telescoping elevator controlled by a
                winch. The robot was equipped with a custom-circuit line follower constructed from photo-sensitive
                resistors and op-amps acting as comparators.

            <h2 id="cs">Programming</h2>
            <p class="content">
                The robot was programmed in C++ using the Arduino suite. The basics of analog and digital IO were used.

            <h2 id="me">Mechanical Analysis</h2>
            <p class="content">
                The robot was analyzed mechanically to determine the gear ratio required to operate the motors at
                optimal efficiency. The torque required to lift the winch with a wooden block was calculated to solve
                for a winch barrel diameter.
            </p>
            <h2 id="ece">Electrical Analysis</h2>
            <p class="content">
                The robot was equiped with a custom line-following sensor. This sensor used two photosensitive resistors
                in voltage-dividers to supply an analog light reading from each side of the robot. The analog values
                were passed into a simple PID controller to keep the robot centered on a white line.
