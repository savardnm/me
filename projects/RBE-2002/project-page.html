            <h2 id="desc">Project Description</h2>
            <p class=content>Robin has been captured! The boy wonder has been kidnapped and held hostage in one of the
                buildings of Gotham city. The goal of this project was to construct and
                program a robot to autonomously navigate the city of "Gotham" to find Robin's "Distress Beacon", an IR
                Beacon displaying at a frequency of 1000kHz.
                The main challenge is: the field is randomized before each attempt. First, the locations of buildings are
                randomized. There are a total of 3 buildings and 1 roadblock, which can be in any plot labeled within
                the grid. The location of Robin is also randomized, with two decoy beacons transmitting at 100Hz and
                10000KHz.
                <br><br>
                <u>With these challenges we had to design a robot that could:</u><br><br>
                1. navigate a city grid, keeping track of its locations to avoid buildings<br>
                2. identify buildings and the specific IR frequency of Robin's device<br>
                3. deploy a rescue mechanism to save Robin</p>


            <h1 id="nav">Navigation</h1>
            <p class="content">
                Many systems need to work together in order to successfully navigate the city grid.
                First, the robot must know its current location and rotation using forward kinematics.
                Second, the robot must be able to move to a desired location through reverse kinematics.
                Finally, the robot must have an internal logic to navigate the city through a search algorithm.

            <h2 id="forward">Forward Kinematics</h2>
            <p class="content">Forward kinematics is the process of inputing sensor data and using it to determine the
                robot's current position and rotation.
                To do this, we used a 9-DOF IMU and wheel encoders.</p>
            <p class="content">The two sensors we had available were an IMU and a set of encoders on the wheels. The
                9-DOF
                IMU, with a 3- axis accelerometer, gyro, and
                magnetometer The IMU allowed the robot to read data through I2C communications. This data gave
                the robot an absolute heading. However, the magnetometer has a larger settling time for quick rotations,
                making is less accurate after a quick turn.
                The encoders gave us accurate relative wheel position data. This means that it was perfect for measuring
                for
                quick turns, but is heavily affected by sensor drift.
                <br><br>
                We decided to integrate both
                sensors through a complimentary
                filter, with an alpha value favoring the encoder values. This filter allows the encoders to handle the
                delta
                data, while using the IMU magnetometer data to account
                for sensor drift within the encoders.</p>
            <h2 id="reverse">Reverse Kinematics</h2>
            <p class="content">
                In order for our robot to traverse the city, a way calculate a motion path is needed. We used calculated
                this through applying reverse kinematic equations to our differential drive robot. This calculation used
                the
                known position of the chassis to create a goal heading and distance. The robot would use a PID control
                loop
                to turn to the correct heading. Once facing its target, the robot would use another PID loop to drive
                the
                correct distance. During this process, we used the forward kinematics process to measure the error,
                correcting through the PID loops.
            </p>
            <h2 id="search">Search Algorithm</h2>
            <p class="content">Once our low-level navigation tools were created, we could create a higher-level
                nagivation
                logic. To control this, we used a Finite State Machine (FSM). The state machine would determine the
                robot's
                next goal location based on the current objective.</p>

            <p class="label">The planned FSM for our controller</p>
            <p class="content">
                Our FSM controlled the robot's destination. Within that process, a search algorithm was implemented to
                find
                the shortest path. Since all links in the grid are equal, we decided to use a breadth-first search
                algorithm. We ruled out a Dijkstra's algorithm because it would significantly complicate it without a
                large
                benefit. The breadth-first algorithm calculated the shortest distance to the destination. This path
                would
                be recalculated upon hitting walls and roadblocks. The search algorithm was implemented directly on the
                embedded chip in C++.

            <h2 id="distance">Distance Sensors</h2>
            <p class="content">For the robot to respond to its environment, we needed to implement a set of distance
                sensors. For this, we used an ultrasonic sensor and 2 IR distance sensors.
                <br/><br/>
                The ultrasonic sensor was mounted to the front of the robot. It was used to detect walls and roadblocks
                in
                its way. These functions allow the robot to sense and avoid obstacles in its path. The implement this
                sensor, we needed to convert the time between pulses into the distance. We used the conversion rate from
                the
                datasheet to transform the time into the usable distance measurement.
                <br><br>
                The IR distance sensors on the robot were mounted facing the two sides. These sensors were used to
                detect
                passing
                buildings. When a building was detected, the robot could record its position, to search for Robin. The
                sensors input an analog voltage into the robot. We used an equation to transform this voltage into a
                usable
                distance.

            <p class="content">
                The custom sensor on our robot was an IR-receiving diode. This diode was used to pick up the oscillating
                IR
                signal from the beacon. It used the diode to create an oscillating voltage, which was input into a
                custom
                Band-pass filter circuit. This circuit filtered out the high and low frequency values. The circuit was
                required to dampen the incorrect signals by a minimum of -3dB. This output frequency was then passed
                into an
                accumulator circuit, using a capacitor and high-valued resistor to store voltage only when a non-damped
                (1000kHz) signal was received. This sensor voltage was then input into the robot micro-controller. When
                compared to a threshold value, the value would reveal if a beacon was detected.

            <p class="label">The model of the rescue mechanism in its stored and deployed states</p>
            <p class="content">
                The final step in the final project was creating a "Rescue Mechanism" to save robin from the tower. The
                solution was open ended, allowing us to be creative with our solution. My group opted to use a
                "deployable
                fire-escape" to save robin! This fire-escape was constructed as a scissor lift, which would be deployed
                from
                the back of the robot when robin is found.
                <br>
                <br>
                The system was limited to use a single actuator: a Pololu motor.
                This meant that the scissor lift needed to deploy and detach from the body of the robot in a single
                motion.
                This was accomplished by having an ejection pin with the correct length attached to the mobile base of
                the
                lift. When the lift was deployed, as the mobile base moved toward the robot chassis, the ejector pin
                would
                hit the base, pushing the lift off, as seen in the video below.
