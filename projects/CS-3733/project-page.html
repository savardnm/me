                Software Engineering is a core class in the Robotics Sequence at WPI. As a part of WPI's
                Motto: <i>"Lehr und Kunst"</i> or <i>"Theory and Practice</i>, software engineering puts the theory
                we've been learning to the test. Professor Wong leads this class to simulate industry
                development of a given project. This year, we made a navigational Kiosk software in Collaboration
                with
                Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). The collaboration brought realistic data and problems to the
                table.

            <p class="content">
                <i style="font-size: 12px">(Disclaimer: due to the close collaboration with BWH's internal data, we
                    signed an NDA
                    prohibiting
                    us from sharing all of the information from the project.)</i>
            <p class="content">
                In this class, we worked with a group of 10 students to cooperate and create a final program. We
                followed an Agile Scrum Methodology. In this methodology, we had to create the
                program in four intense sprints, with daily scrums, sprint retrospectives, and sprint
                planning meetings. Each member was assigned a role within the group. Lead software engineers lead
                groups of junior engineers. Product managers played the role of company representatives asking for
                certain
                functionality.
                <br><br>
                I played the role of the team Scrum Master. This role gave me the responsibility of guiding the
                scrums and focus our efforts to be agile. I learned a lot from this experience about cooperation and
                collaboration. I also lead the UI/UX design team. This team focused on creating a clean,
                professional, and functional front-end application to interface with the backend functionality such
                as pathfinding within the hospital, handling service requests, and running database queries. My team
                was dedicated to the task and worked hard to create a product we were pround of. At the end of the
                class, the professor, TAs, and department officials judge the projects to pick a winner. After our
                late nights and close coordination, our team won the competition.

                Throughout the project, we followed an Agile Scrum Methodology. In this methodology, I played the role
                of Scrum Master. I took this as an opportunity to improve my communication and leadership skills. I also
                researched the key aspects of agile workflow such as vertical development, open team dynamics, and
                problem resolution. Going through this project has prepared me for following the agile scrum methodology
                in the workplace.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                As scrum master, I ran daily scrums, sprint planning meetings, and
                sprint retrospectives. I also managed the team's Jira to keep track of the product backlog, sprint
                items, and user-story points.
                <br><br>
                In daily stand-up scrums, I brought the team through a discussion of
                individual accomplishments, challenges, and goals, which allowed us to
                understand the work of others and their objectives. During sprint planning meetings, we would use
                t-shirt sizing and scrum poker to determine user story points for given tasks tracked in Jira. We would
                then select a set of them that were attainable within one sprint. In sprint retrospectives, we worked as
                a group to identify our strengths and weaknesses for the week. We set plans to address our issues and
                improve for the coming sprint.

                For the production of our project, I lead the UI team in creating a clean and professional UI. I worked
                with three other members: Max Spiegelhoff, Suvirno Frith and Andrew Whitney. We also had strong
                communications with the
                Database, pathfinding, and prototyping teams. We worked together to integrate each aspect of the project
                into a smooth end-user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Because of my design experience, I selected a Material Theme for the application, following the
                guidelines and recommendations from google's documentation. This team gave us a clean and understandable
                UI. We also created a set up custom icons and visual keys to help the user navigate the program. I made
                these using Inkscape, a vector-art software. Working with vector art, We also implemented a vector
                overlay for the program, allowing users to highlight selected locations.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                By the end of the project, our UI incorporated the many aspects of the program's back-end communication,
                in a complete polished final product.
