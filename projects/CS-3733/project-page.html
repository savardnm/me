            <h2 id="desc">Project Description</h2>
            <p class="content">Software Engineering is a core class in the Robotics Sequence at WPI. As a part of WPI's
                Motto: <i>"Lehr und Kunst"</i> or <i>"Theory and Practice</i>, software engineering puts the theory
                we've been learning to the test. Professor Wong leads this class as if you are participating in industry
                development of a given project. This year, we made a navigational Kiosk software in Collaboration with
                Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). The collaboration brought realistic data and problems to the table.
                <i>(Although, due to the close collaboration with BWH's internal data, we had to sign an NDA prohibiting
                    us
                    from sharing their information, leaving me with less to show off here)</i>
                <br><br>
                In this class, we worked with a group of 10 students to cooperate and create a final program. On top of
                this, the class follows an Agile Scrum Methodology. In this methodology, we had to create the program in
                four heavily intense sprints, with daily scrums, sprint retrospectives, and sprint planning meetings.
                Each member was assigned a role within the group. Lead software engineers lead groups of junior
                engineers. Product managers played the role of company representatives asking for certain functionality.
                <br><br>
                I played the role of the team Scrum Master. This role gave me the responsibility of guiding the scrums
                and focus our efforts to be agile. I learned a lot from this experience about cooperation and
                collaboration. I had to face my fair share of challenges, but I came out learning a lot.

            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p class="content">
                Our program was coded using HTML5 and JavaScript. The website was hosted on GitHub Pages. Since we did
                not have access to a web server, we made it a passive website, which could be hosted on GitHub.
            </p>
            <h3>API</h3>
            <p class="content">Our program interacted with the same API as 25Live to get reservation data for all the
                rooms, from all buildings on campus. The program sorted through this data to find rooms without current
                reservations. These open rooms can be found by pressing the "Study Now" Button.
                <br><br>
                The user can also select
                a date/time they want to study later. This allows the student to plan the locations they can work on
                campus ahead of time</p>
            <img src="projects/Study@WPI/calendar.png" class="fullpic">
            <p class="content">The website also provides links to the various reservation systems implemented by WPI for
                individual locations. This includes: 25Live for rooms, LibCal for library suites, and Foisie-LibCal for
                tech suites. </p>
